# Mobile Development: Reusable Educational App

# Project description:

## Main task:
The task is to develop a reusable educational app. 

## Targeted users:
Our target audience here are mobile app developers. In other words, they should be able to reuse our project to build their own apps on top of it.

## The expected result:
Implement a common functionality that can be reused by other developers:
Layer 1: a generic learning app with course displays, course and lesson choices, lesson flow, and learning scores.
Layer 2: A simple reward system with an in-app store to buy digital perks for the score gained by completing things.
Layer 3: Unstructured data parser that can turn a book or website into a course.
